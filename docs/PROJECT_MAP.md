### Data (`backend/data/`)

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `program_requirements.json` | Structured program data for Program Explorer |

### Logs (created at runtime, not in git)

| File | What it tracks |
|---|---|
| `queries.log` | Every chat question + retrieval stats |
| `feedback.log` | Thumbs up/down |
| `no_context.log` | Questions where search found nothing |

|---|---|
| Frontend | Vercel |

| Vector DB | Pinecone |
| Auth | Clerk |
| Repo | github.com/Retriive/campusQ |

## "Something broke" — where to look

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| Wrong answer | `queries.log` → retrieval scores. Then `retrieval.py` / `main.py` prompt |
| No answer / "I don't know" | `no_context.log` → data gap → run scrapers |
| Course not found | `course_misses.log` → `scrape_courses.py` |
| Bad source links | `citations.py` |
| Deploy broke chat | Run smoke gate on production |
| Frontend won't load | `frontend/` console errors, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` |
