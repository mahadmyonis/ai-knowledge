# CampusQ

**CampusQ** is Retriive's AI academic assistant for university students. Students ask questions about courses, programs, deadlines, and registration — and get answers backed by official university data.

**Live today:** Carleton University (beta)  
**Coming soon:** uOttawa, UofT, Waterloo, Western (waitlist landing pages)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Retriive/campusQ.git
cd campusQ
```

### 2. Backend

```bash
cd backend
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt    # Windows — use py -m on Windows
```

Create `backend/.env`:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
PINECONE_API_KEY=...
COHERE_API_KEY=...          # optional — better reranking
```

Start the API:

```bash
py -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 3. Frontend (new terminal)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:3000**

### 4. Run quality check

```bash
cd backend
py evals/quality_gate.py --tier smoke
```

**10/10 = OK to deploy.** See [docs/QUALITY_GATE.md](docs/QUALITY_GATE.md).
