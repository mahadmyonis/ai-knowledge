Students may repeat a course they have already passed in order to improve their grade.
When a course is repeated, only the most recent grade counts toward the CGPA — even if
the new grade is lower than the original grade. The earlier grade is placed in the
"Forfeit" category and no longer affects the CGPA.

Key points:
- You CAN repeat a passed course. There is no rule against it.
- Only the LATEST attempt counts toward your CGPA, regardless of which grade is higher.
- The previous grade is forfeited — it does not count toward graduation credits.
- If you repeat a course and get a lower grade, your CGPA will drop.
- Repeated courses are noted on your transcript.

After the first week but before the official add deadline, you can still add courses
directly through Carleton Central without any special permission.

After the official add deadline:
- You cannot add a course through Carleton Central on your own.
- You must submit a Registration Override Request (ROR) through Carleton Central.
- The instructor and department must approve the override.
- Late adds are not guaranteed — it is at the discretion of the department.
- Late additions may result in missed coursework that cannot be made up.

Key dates (Fall 2026):
- Last day to add full fall / fall-winter courses: September 22, 2026
- After this date: Override Request required

For Winter 2027:
- Last day to add full winter courses: January 19, 2027

1. Log into Carleton Central
2. Go to Registration Override Request

- 20.0 credits
- Science degree (not engineering)
- Core COMP, MATH, STAT — algorithms, theory, programming foundations
- Optional streams exist (AI, cybersecurity, game dev, Software Engineering stream, etc.)

Good standing at Carleton means you are Eligible to Continue (EC) in your program.
Minimum Overall CGPA thresholds depend on your program type AND how many credits you
have completed. Do NOT assume a single number like 4.00 for everyone.

Standard ACE thresholds (Undergraduate Calendar Section 3.2.6, Table 1):

HONOURS programs (most B.A./B.Sc. Honours):
- Fewer than 5.5 credits completed: Overall CGPA 4.00
- 5.5 credits or more completed: Overall CGPA 5.00
- 15.5+ credits completed: also Major CGPA 6.50

ENGINEERING programs:
- Overall CGPA 5.00 at all credit levels

15-CREDIT and 20-CREDIT NON-HONOURS programs:
- Overall CGPA 4.00 (Major CGPA may also apply at higher credit bands)

BAS Design: Overall 4.00 throughout.
BID: 3.50 (<5.5 credits), then 4.00.

ACE checks run at the end of each term in which the student completes a course.

3. When you repeat and pass, the new grade replaces the old one in your CGPA.
4. The F grade is moved to the Forfeit category and no longer counts.

Academic standing impact:
- A failing grade lowers your CGPA immediately.
- If your CGPA drops below the minimum threshold, you may receive an Academic Warning
  or be Required to Withdraw through the Academic Continuation Evaluation (ACE).
- You should retake the failed course as soon as possible to recover your CGPA.
