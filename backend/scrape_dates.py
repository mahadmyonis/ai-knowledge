"""
scrape_dates.py — Structured ingestion of key academic dates.

The academic-dates page is one dense page where each date is a single line among
hundreds. Scraped as ~500-word chunks, any single deadline gets buried and embeds
poorly. This script instead creates ONE clean, synonym-rich vector PER deadline,
so "when's the payment deadline?" matches a focused chunk about exactly that.

Source of truth is shared with the frontend deadline-tracker.tsx — keep them in
sync when Carleton publishes a new calendar year.
